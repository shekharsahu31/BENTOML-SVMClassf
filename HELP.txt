python train.py - cmd  ### copy the model tag

bentoml models list - cmd

#### C:// - Users - Vipul sahu - bentoml - models - ...... - YAML file / Pickle file

python test.py

python service.py ----- ### optimise model inferecing

bentoml serve service.py:svc --reload -> use to run service.py as an API or to make an API
                                        reload is used so that it auto reloads/debugs on any changes
                                        like in fast api app.runt(debug  =True)
                                        service.py - file name  , svc - service name

localhost:3000
get - [[1,2,4,5]] - check for o/p

WE can do same using JSON also -
localhost:3000/classify or 127.0.0.1:3000/classify - POST request
Body - Test-> JSON
[[1,2,3,4]] -> SEND




#bentofile.yaml - > to tell bentoml to package(entire application) all this so we can 
                   easily deploy the things out in cloud.


bentoml build - serach for yaml file , runs it , first try to create service
                using service.py:svc and then look for other py files also (test.py is not that imp.)
                and than look for packages and install packages too.

we will get more options like to contanizer our application or upload out application
to bentocloud.


bentoml list - shows list of all bentoml applications build as a complete package.
 this will be stored in C:// - Users -  shekhar - bentoml - bentos - .... - here you can see everything is there for a packaged application.

 We have docker file created also so we can use that and make a docker image and push it to REPO. or using CI/CD github actions and AWS/Azure we can also deploy the application.
